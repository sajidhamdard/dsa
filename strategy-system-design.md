## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step System Design Learning Plan**

### ⚙️ **Stage 1 — Foundations (2–3 weeks)**  
*Goal*: Understand core components + terminology clearly

| What to Learn | Resources |
|---------------|-----------|
| **What is system design?** | Grokking System Design (paid course — worth it), or free YouTube intro videos |
| **Scalability basics** | Vertical vs Horizontal scaling, Load balancer, Caching, CDN, Database replication |
| **CAP Theorem, Consistency models** | CAP Theorem, Strong vs Eventual Consistency |
| **Latency vs Throughput** | Basic network/infra understanding |

✅ **Action plan**:  
– Start a **System Design Notes doc** (same as your DSA notes style)  
– For each concept: Definition, When to use, Pros/Cons  
– Draw **simple diagrams** (helps a lot)

---

### 🏗️ **Stage 2 — Components Deep Dive (3–4 weeks)**  
*Goal*: Understand key building blocks used in most real systems

| Component | Learn What / How |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Load Balancer | Types, L7 vs L4, Algorithms (Round Robin, Least Connections) |
| Caching | Redis, Memcached, Write-through / Write-back / Cache eviction |
| Database | SQL vs NoSQL, Sharding, Replication, Indexes |
| Message Queues | Kafka, RabbitMQ, When to use queues |
| CDN | How CDN works, Akamai / Cloudflare |
| Rate Limiter | Token bucket, Leaky bucket |

✅ **Action plan**:  
– For each component → make a **1-pager cheat sheet** (Definition + When to use + Diagram)

---

### 🖼️ **Stage 3 — End-to-End Design Problems (6–8 weeks)**  
*Goal*: Learn how to **combine components** and design real systems

| Problem | Key Concepts Covered |
|---------|----------------------|
| Design URL Shortener | DB schema, Hashing, Cache |
| Design Instagram | Feed generation, Scaling reads/writes, CDN |
| Design WhatsApp | Consistency, Messaging queue |
| Design Rate Limiter | Sliding window, Redis |
| Design YouTube | Video storage, CDN, Load balancing |
| Design Uber | Geospatial queries, Real-time updates |

✅ **Action plan**:  
– For each problem:  
🔹 **Problem statement (clear requirements)**  
🔹 **High-level design (component diagram)**  
🔹 **Detailed design (APIs, DB schema, component tradeoffs)**  
🔹 **Bottlenecks + scaling**  
🔹 **Mistakes / Learnings** *(same style as your DSA notes)*

---

### 📚 **Best Resources (Pick any 1–2 max — don't overload)**

| Resource | Why it’s good |
|----------|---------------|
| **Grokking Modern System Design** (paid) | Very structured for interview-style designs |
| **System Design Primer (GitHub)** (free) | Very comprehensive concepts & problems |
| **YouTube — Gaurav Sen / Hussein Nasser** | Clear explanations, diagrams, real systems |
| **Designing Data Intensive Applications (book)** | Deeper understanding (for later stage) |

---

### 🔄 **Stage 4 — Revision + Mock Designs (Ongoing)**  
*Goal*: Be able to **explain + diagram + discuss tradeoffs** confidently

✅ For each design:  
– Can you **whiteboard it** in 45–60 mins?  
– Can you **explain tradeoffs** (why Redis vs Memcached, SQL vs NoSQL)?  
– Can you **identify bottlenecks and scale** the system?

✅ **Mock designs**: Every 2–3 weeks, try doing a design problem **without notes** → then compare to your earlier notes.

## ✅ **First 5 Concepts to start this week (System Design — Foundations)**

I’m giving you **only the most foundational ones** — once these are strong, you can move fast later.

| Concept | Why start here? | Example System relevance |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Load Balancer** | Entry point for scalable system | Any web service, Instagram, Uber |
| **Caching** | Must-know for latency reduction | Feed generation, Search, Profile info |
| **Database — SQL vs NoSQL** | Core data storage — need right choice | E-commerce, Social networks |
| **Sharding & Replication** | How to scale DB horizontally + make it fault tolerant | Twitter followers, Instagram posts |
| **Message Queue** | Handles async jobs, decouples systems | WhatsApp messaging, Uber notifications |

🔹 **Tip**: Spend ~1 day per concept.  
Goal = understand *what is it, why do we use it, pros/cons, basic diagram*  
After this, you’ll be ready to combine them in real design problems.

---

## ✍️ **Note-taking template (for Notion or Google Doc)**

You can **copy-paste** this block every time for each concept or problem.

---

### 📌 **Concept / Problem Name**

**Definition**  
→ Clear 1–2 line definition

**When to use (use-cases)**  
→ List situations where this is useful

**Advantages**  
–  
–  
–  

**Disadvantages / Tradeoffs**  
–  
–  
–  

**Real-life examples**  
→ Where have you seen this used? (Product examples)

**Diagram**  
→ Simple block diagram (can hand-draw & attach OR make in Excalidraw / draw.io)

**Mistakes / Learnings (revision notes)**  
→ Things you misunderstood first  
→ Common interview gotchas

---

## 📂 **Folder structure suggestion** (Optional but powerful)

You can organize your notes like this (Google Drive or Notion):

```
System Design Notes
├── 01 Foundations
│   ├── Load Balancer.md
│   ├── Caching.md
│   ├── SQL vs NoSQL.md
│   ├── Sharding & Replication.md
│   └── Message Queue.md
├── 02 Design Problems
│   ├── Design URL Shortener.md
│   ├── Design Instagram.md
│   └── ...
├── 03 Diagrams (optional images folder)
│   ├── LoadBalancer.png
