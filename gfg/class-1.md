**Asymptotic analysis** is a way to describe the **efficiency of an algorithm** (usually time or space) in terms of **input size** as the input grows **very large (approaches infinity)**. It helps us understand how an algorithm behaves in the **worst, best, or average case**, without worrying about machine-specific constants or small input sizes.

---

### 🔍 **Key Concepts:**

1. **Focus on Input Size (n):**
   Asymptotic analysis looks at how the algorithm scales as `n → ∞`.

2. **Ignores Constants and Lower-Order Terms:**
   For large `n`, constants and smaller terms are negligible.
   For example, `f(n) = 3n² + 5n + 10` becomes `Θ(n²)`.

3. **Compares Algorithm Efficiency:**
   It allows you to compare two algorithms independent of hardware.

---

### ✅ **Why Is It Useful?**

* You don’t need to run the program to evaluate performance.
* It gives a standard way to express and compare complexity.
* Helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm for large datasets.

### 🧠 **Types of Asymptotic Notation:**

| Notation    | Meaning                            | Example                                           |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **O(f(n))** | Upper Bound (Worst Case)           | `O(n²)` means it grows no faster than `n²`        |
| **Ω(f(n))** | Lower Bound (Best Case)            | `Ω(n)` means it takes at least `n` steps          |
| **Θ(f(n))** | Tight Bound (Average/Typical Case) | `Θ(n log n)` means it always grows like `n log n` |

---

### 📌 Example:

Suppose you have this loop:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

* This runs `n` times → Time Complexity: **O(n)** (Linear time)

---

### 🧪 Summary:

* Asymptotic analysis = performance for large input sizes.
* Ignores constants and small variations.
* Uses Big-O, Big-Ω, and Big-Θ to describe time/space complexity.

---

### 🔁 **Code Structure (Nested Loops)**

```cpp
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        cout << i + j << endl;
    }
}
```

---

### ⏱️ **Time Complexity (TC)**

* Outer loop runs **`n` times**
* Inner loop runs **`m` times** for each iteration of the outer loop
* Inside the inner loop: constant time operation (`cout`)

**Total operations = n × m**

🔸 **Time Complexity: `O(n * m)`**

---

### 🧠 **Space Complexity (SC)**

* `i` and `j` are loop variables → take constant space
* `cout` operation doesn't store anything
* No arrays, dynamic allocations, or recursive calls

🔸 **Space Complexity: `O(1)`**

---

### 💡 **Auxiliary Space (Extra runtime space)**

* No extra space used apart from a few variables
* No recursion or additional data structures

🔸 **Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)`
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

---

Now we are printing a **matrix of strings** instead of integers:

```cpp
arr => matrix of strings

for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        cout << arr[i][j] << endl;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ **Loop Execution Count** (Still the same):

* Outer loop: `n` times
* Inner loop: `m` times per outer iteration
* Total iterations: `n * m`

So structurally, the **loop still runs `O(n * m)` times**.

---

### 🚨 Difference: **What happens inside the loop**

* You’re now printing a **string**, not an integer.
* The time to print a string depends on its **length**.
* If all strings are of average length **`k`**, then:

  * `cout << arr[i][j]` takes **`O(k)`** time per operation.

---

### 🧠 **Updated Time Complexity:**

Each of the `n * m` iterations takes `O(k)` time (where `k` = average string length):

🔸 **Time Complexity = `O(n * m * k)`**

> This is **slower** than printing integers because printing strings takes time proportional to their length.

---

### 📦 Space Complexity:

* The matrix stores `n * m` strings, each of length ≈ `k`
* So total memory used: `O(n * m * k)`
* No extra memory is used during traversal

🔸 **Space Complexity: `O(n * m * k)`**
🔸 **Auxiliary Space: `O(1)`** (if we're only printing, not allocating anything extra at runtime)

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m * k)` (k = average string length)
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n * m * k)`
* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)`

---

This image explains the **time complexity analysis** of processing a list of strings in two steps. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### 🧾 **Problem Setup:**

* Input: `n` strings of length `m` each.
  Example input:
  `["abd", "dfg", "bca", "ddb"]`
* Goal: Perform **two steps** on them.
* Let `n = number of strings` and `m = length of each string`.

---

### ✅ **Step-by-step Analysis:**

---

### 🔹 **Step 1: Sort characters of each string**

* `"abd"` → `"abd"`
* `"dfg"` → `"dfg"`
* `"bca"` → `"abc"`
* `"ddb"` → `"bdd"`

This is sorting individual strings → each takes `O(m log m)` time.
There are `n` strings.

➡️ **Step 1 Time Complexity:**

```
O(n * m log m)
```

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Sort the entire list of strings**

Input to this step (after step 1):
`["abd", "dfg", "abc", "bdd"]` → Sort these lexicographically →
`["abc", "abd", "bdd", "dfg"]`

Now you're sorting `n` strings, where each comparison takes `O(m)` time (since comparing strings of length `m`).

➡️ **Step 2 Time Complexity:**

```
O(n log n * m) = O(n m log n)
```

Some alternatives:

* If you treat each string as a key of `length m`, this is equivalent to:

```
O(n * m log n)
```

Or more generally:

```
O(n m log n)
```

✅ The image correctly *rejects* a naive and wrong `O((n log n)^2)` estimate.

---

### 🔚 **Final Time Complexity:**

Step 1: `O(n m log m)`
Step 2: `O(n m log n)`

🟰 **Total:**

```
O(n m log m + n m log n) = O(n m log(nm))
```

Using the identity:
`log(nm) = log n + log m`

This is the correct **tight bound**.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Step        | Operation            | Time Complexity    |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Step 1      | Sort each string     | O(n m log m)       |
| Step 2      | Sort list of strings | O(n m log n)       |
| **Overall** | Combined             | **O(n m log(nm))** |

---

### ✅ When we say **“using the identity”**, it refers to a known **mathematical property** (or formula) used to simplify an expression.

---

### 🔍 The Identity in Question:

$$
\log(n \cdot m) = \log n + \log m
$$

This is a **logarithmic identity**. It’s always true for positive values of `n` and `m`.

---

### 🧠 Why Use This Identity?

In time complexity analysis, we often get expressions like:

* $O(n \cdot m \cdot \log n + n \cdot m \cdot \log m)$

We can factor out common terms:

$$
O(nm (\log n + \log m))
$$

And then apply the identity:

$$
\log n + \log m = \log(nm)
$$

So:

$$
O(nm (\log n + \log m)) = O(nm \log(nm))
$$

---

### 💡 Meaning of “Using the Identity” in this context:

It means you're **simplifying the expression** using a well-known mathematical rule (the logarithmic addition rule in this case).

---

### 📌 Summary:

> “Using the identity $\log(nm) = \log n + \log m$” means you are simplifying or transforming your expression using this **logarithmic rule**.
