Time complexity of **O(log log n)** is very rare, but it does appear in a few specific algorithms or operations. Here are some **examples and scenarios** where you may encounter **O(log log n)**:

---

### ✅ **1. Finding the inverse Ackermann function (Disjoint Set / Union-Find with path compression + union by rank)**

* **Operation**: `find` or `union`
* **Amortized Time Complexity**:

  * In theory, the time complexity is **O(α(n))**, where α(n) is the **inverse Ackermann function**.
  * Since α(n) grows even **slower** than log log n, we sometimes say it’s *"almost constant time"*, and it’s **less than or equal to O(log log n)** for all practical inputs.

### ✅ **2. Van Emde Boas Tree (vEB Tree) operations**

* **Data Structure**: vEB Tree (used for integer keys in a bounded universe)
* **Operations**: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, `predecessor`, `successor`
* **Time Complexity**: **O(log log U)**, where `U` is the size of the universe.
* Example: If keys are bounded within \[1, 2^32], then U = 2^32 → log log U = log log (2^32) = log 32 = 5.

### ✅ **3. Binary Search on a Sorted Array of Size log n**

* **Scenario**: If you're doing **binary search** on an array of size **log n**, it takes **log (log n)** steps.
* Use case example: You're searching inside a preprocessed structure where size has already been reduced to log n.

### ✅ **4. Counting number of digits in n (base-2)**

* **Operation**: Counting number of bits needed to represent `log n`
* **Time Complexity**: `O(log log n)`
* Example:

  ```java
  int bits = (int)(Math.log(Math.log(n)) / Math.log(2));
  ```

### ✅ **5. Some advanced Prime Sieving algorithms**

* For example, **Sieve of Atkin** or **Wheel factorization** techniques in number theory may involve sub-logarithmic factors in time complexity like **O(n / log log n)** or similar.
